*Auxilixary classifier  
in some cases, it is possible to calculate the cross-entropy and cost function at intermediate layers of a neural network. This is done by using a technique called “auxiliary classifiers” or “auxiliary heads”. These auxiliary classifiers are added to intermediate layers of a neural network and are trained to predict the class labels. The cross-entropy and cost function can then be calculated at these intermediate layers as well.
